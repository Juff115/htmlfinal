	    Summary of Living Material
	</h1>
        <p>
	    Some material engineers at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) have created a hybrid living material that combines aspects of living and non living things.
	</p>
	<p>
	    These materials can respond to their environment, grow in size, and reproduce (repair them selves). The materials also conduct electricity and give off light.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Materials like these can be used for many things such as highly energy efficent systems, self healing structures, solar cells, diagnostic sensors, and scaffolding used for tissue engineering.
	</p>
	<p>
	    New materials of this nature will revolutionize the world as we know it open a whole new way that our produts and material items work and help in our lives.
